        <h2>Larry Schultis-Founder</h2>
        
        <P class="bio_info">Larry Schultis has over 20 years of experience negotiating technology transactions and outsourcing agreements. He has represented both technology consumers and vendors – including significant outsourcing arrangements for major healthcare providers, utilities, a Big Four accounting firm, and one of the world’s largest financial institutions. He has also represented a variety of service providers, including a top-ten consulting firm, market leaders in network security software and credit card processing, broadcast networks, numerous software developers, as well firms providing customer care, patient records and video processing services.

        Prior to starting Schultis Law, Larry spent ten years engaged in IP transaction work as a partner at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. But it’s his prior experience in the IT industry that gives Larry an edge over many other lawyers. Larry first worked as a programmer, then a systems analyst, and finally an IT director for a prestigious law firm. Although the technology has changed since Larry’s early days in IT, his real-world experience in IT project delivery gives him a unique perspective and insight into his clients’ businesses, and enables him to offer a blend of legal experience and business strategy to complement corporate management.</P>
