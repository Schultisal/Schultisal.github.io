  <h1>Schultis Law Group PLLC</h1>

  <hr>

    <p>
      Schultis Law Group focuses on outsourcing, licensing, and related technology and commercial transactions.

      We’ve represented both sides of the table. Unlike some larger firms’ outsourcing practices, which typically engage in only customer-side transactions, we have substantial experience in both the customer- and supplier-side transactions, so we can relate to the goals and the risks that each party has in a transaction.

      Our background is the tech business. Prior to becoming a lawyer, Larry Schultis worked in the IT industry – first as a programmer, then a systems analyst, and finally an IT director for a prestigious law firm. Larry stays abreast of the advances in development methodologies and project management to offer a blend of legal experience and real-world experience in IT project delivery that gives him unique perspective and insight into his clients’ businesses. So when we say, “We understand your business,” we have the experience to support our claim.
